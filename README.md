## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Mechanical Engineer with a passion for problem-solving and a newfound interest in Web Development. After years of designing and optimizing mechanical systems, I've decided to expand my skill set and dive into the world of code. My engineering background gives me a unique perspective on how to approach challenges, and I'm excited to apply that mindset to building web applications.
