## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Mechanical Engineer with a passion for problem-solving and a newfound interest in Web Development. After years of designing and optimizing mechanical systems, I've decided to expand my skill set and dive into the world of code. My engineering background gives me a unique perspective on how to approach challenges, and I'm excited to apply that mindset to building web applications.

ðŸ”§ Skills & Tools
Mechanical Engineering: CAD, FEA, SolidWorks, MATLAB
Web Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js
Version Control: Git, GitHub
Currently Learning: Python, APIs, Responsive Design
ðŸŒ± Current Focus
I'm currently focused on building full-stack web applications and learning more about frontend frameworks like React. I'm also exploring the backend with Node.js and working on integrating APIs into my projects.

ðŸŽ¯ Goals
Build a portfolio of web development projects.
Contribute to open-source projects to gain real-world experience.
Transition into a full-time web developer role.
ðŸ“š Projects
Automatic elevation system:  mechanism designed to control the vertical movement (elevation) of a platform, object, or device automatically. These systems are commonly used in various fields such as construction, military applications, automotive engineering, robotics, and aerospace, where precise control of elevation is required
Regenerative braking in EV bicycle: a technology that allows the bike to recover some of the kinetic energy lost during braking and convert it back into electrical energy, which is then stored in the battery. This process helps to extend the range of the bicycle by utilizing energy that would otherwise be wasted.
More to come!
